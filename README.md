This project is a curated online exhibition highlighting the evolution of imaging techniques in photography over the decades. The centerpiece is a Sankey Diagram showcasing the top three techniques each decade, serving as a control panel for nine lenses on the side. The lenses not only display quantitative changes in technology but also enable interactive exploration of photographic works. The goal is to allow the audience to appreciate the charm of various imaging technologies, observing their rise, decline, and impact on each era.

When first entering this page, I hope my audience can place their focus on the kaleidoscope. Therefore, I've created an animation that allows them to load in one by one, corresponding to different eras.
By adopting this animation, I aim to provide my audience with a clear lens to capture the unique atmospheres present in photos from different eras.

I set this Sankey Diagram as the second layer of information for the project, providing a more analytical perspective on the topic. However, it's not just about conveying information; I've turned it into a controller. When you hover your mouse over it, it pops up from the background. 
Also, each node and link can interact with the main visuals. Additionally, it automatically displays information about the collection in labels next to the main visuals.

And the last one I want to share is the hover-menu. Each blade of the nine kaleidoscopes is a color abstraction from a real photograph.
To enhance readability, I've also created a hover menu for each, allowing users to access the original photo and increasing visibility through this function.
